 Why state-driven views are important to us as software developers today? What are state-driven applications? Why are they powerful? How does React enables those patterns?

 Using states in our apps we can use components in isolation that gives us a lot of benefits. 
 The apps will be a lot easier to understand/mantain. Furthermore because we have all elements isolate it will become really easy to test out different components. Another huge benefit is that will be easier to produce a visual documentation, that will help others a lot to understand how your app works.
